This project aims to emaulate a Z80 chip with the specific aim of running the ZX Spectrum 48k ROM. Therefore it will be heavily tailored towards the architecture of that machine.

NOTE: Development is very much work-in-progress. The principle is to develop this in a fairly organic way as part of its aim is to be simply a hobby project (i.e. something to tinker with in my spare time).

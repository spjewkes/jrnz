This project aims to emulate a Z80 chip. To begin with, the project aim to allow running of a binary containing Z80 code with options to get output of the operation. Some of these elements will be added as the project is developed.

*NOTE: this project is work-in-progress. The aim is to have something that can be run at every commit but the overall application is not feature complete*

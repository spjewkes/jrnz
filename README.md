# Peoject JRNZ

This project aims to emaulate a Z80 chip with the specific aim of running the ZX Spectrum 48k ROM. Therefore it will be heavily tailored towards the architecture of that machine.

Please note that development is very much work-in-progress. The principle is to develop this in a fairly organic way as part of its aim is to be simply a hobby project (i.e. something to tinker with in my spare time). This project is in no way a complete emulator nor would I recommend using it for any serious emulation. There are plenty of better ones out there!

# Milestones

This proiject aims to emaulate a Z80 chop with the specific aim of running the ZX Spectrum 48k ROM. Therefore it will be heavily tailored towards the architecture of that machine. At some point be refactored to split out the CPU emulator from the rest of the system.

NOTE: Development is very much work-in-progress. The principle is to develop this in a fairly organic way as it is also here to provide myself with something to tinker with in my spare time.
